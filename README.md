# Sales-Prediction-using-Python
🔍 Project Overview
Sales prediction is a vital aspect of business strategy, enabling companies to estimate future revenue and optimize their marketing investments. In this project, we use Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to predict product sales based on advertising budgets across different platforms (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).

By analyzing past advertising spending and corresponding sales, businesses can make data-driven decisions, maximize profits, and allocate budgets effectively.

📌 Why Sales Prediction Matters?
✔ Helps businesses optimize advertising budgets
✔ Predicts future sales trends for strategic planning
✔ Identifies the most effective marketing channels
✔ Reduces unnecessary spending and improves ROI (Return on Investment)

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍 (Programming Language)
Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing & Analysis)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Model)
🚀 How It Works?
1️⃣ Data Collection
We use a dataset containing advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspapers, along with recorded sales.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We analyze and visualize the relationships between advertising spend and sales performance to identify trends and correlations.

3️⃣ Model Training (Linear Regression)
We train a Linear Regression model, which learns from past data and predicts future sales based on advertising investments.

4️⃣ Sales Prediction & Performance Evaluation
The trained model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its accuracy. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared Score (R²) help measure model performance.

📊 Expected Insights
📌 Which advertising platform (TV, Radio, or Newspaper) has the highest impact on sales?
📌 How much sales increase can be expected with a higher marketing budget?
📌 What is the optimal budget allocation for maximum profit?

💡 Future Improvements
✅ Implement advanced models (Random Forest, Decision Trees) for better accuracy
✅ Use real-time data to make dynamic sales predictions
✅ Integrate online and social media advertising data for broader analysis
